## About Me
My name is Rylan Petroelje, and I’m a Junior at Grand Valley State University studying Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Spanish. I primarily work with Python and C, but I’m also experienced in Bash, Gawk, Sed, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java. I serve on the executive board of the GVSU colony of Triangle Fraternity, a nationally recognized STEM fraternity, where I spend much of my free time collaborating and socializing with the active brothers.

## Hobbies

## Technical Background
The first coding language I learned was C++ at around 14 years old. Since then I have become familiar with many different languages, such as Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, and more. I have applied these skills in VEX robotics, internships, and  classes within and outside of my major. Over the past two years, I’ve worked as a Search Engine Optimization Specialist at Granite Woods Printing, contributing to backend and frontend web development. In summer 2025, I led a team of 4–5 in developing internal software for the company.
